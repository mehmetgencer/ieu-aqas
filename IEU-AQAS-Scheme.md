# Curriculum to outcomes

## Program outcomes (PO) definition

Each program, $p$, is defined as a set of program outcomes, $O_p$.

## Course activities to learning outcomes (LO)

Let $C_p$ be the set of core courses in a diploma programme, $p$. For any course, $c \in C_p$, there is a set of learning outcomes, $L_c$.

Each course has a set of assessment activities, $A_c$. Each activity of a course, $a \in A_c$, contributes to one or more of the course learning outcomes. For example, $LOcontrib_{c,a,l}$ is the  contribution of activity $a \in A_c$ to learning outcome $l \in L_c$ for course $c$. These contributions form a preliminarly A-to-LO contribution matrix for the course, $X'_c$ , whose elements are $x'^{c}_{a,l}= LOcontrib_{c,a,l}$ .

For the sake of simplicity the matrix $X'_c$ is a binary matrix, i.e. the values $LOcontrib_{c,a,l}$ can take only values 0 or 1. However, there is also the problem that activities are of  different weightage, $w_{c,a}$, forming a weightage matrix of the course activities, $\mathbf{w_c}$. For example, weight of final exam can be 30% (i.e. 0.3) whereas a homework can be 10%. To account for these differences we use a weighted A-to-LO contribution matrix: $X_c=\mathbf{w_c} X'_c$

Each course also has an ECTS credit value, $ects_c$ which will be used later for the level of contribution.

## From LO to PO

In order to assess achievement of program outcomes, $O_p$, for a course in the program, $c \in C_p$, its learning outcomes will be mapped to program outcomes. For example contribution value of a learning outcome, $l \in L_c$ to a program outcome, $o \in O_p$ is denoted as $POcontrib_{c,l,o}$. These contributions form a LO-to-PO contribution matrix for the program, $Y_c$, whose elements are $y^c_{l,o}=POcontrib_{c,l,o}$.

For the sake of simplicity the matrix $Y_c$ is a binary matrix, i.e. the values $POcontrib_{c,l,o}$ can take only values 0 or 1.

# Evaluation

## Design (curriculum) level evaluation: Curriculum spport for program outcomes

Here the aim is to evaluate the level which courses in the curriculum, via their learning outcomes, support the program outcomes.

A first step to compute this would be to compute contribution of a course to programme outcomes as $T^c=Y_c^T X_c$, and collapse the activities level to obtain a vector of PO contributions of a course. Let us denote this resulting vector as $\mathbf{z^c}$ whose elements represent contribution of all activities of the course to each program outcome $o_i$, i.e. $z^c_i=\sum_{j}t_{i,j}$

One can then sum this over all courses in a program's curriculum to find the support for program outcomes: $\sum_{c \in C_p}\mathbf{z^c}$. However, the main problem here is that courses have different ECTS values, different number of learning outcomes and different number of program outcomes each LO contributes to. Thus, values in the total contribution vector of a course to program outcomes, $TotalContrib_c=\sum\mathbf{z^c}$, can be very different across courses and not necessarily proportional to course's ECTS credits. Hence a **normalization** is needed. A straightforward solution is to ensure that sum of contributions of a course is equal to its ECTS credit, by normalizing as:

$$ \mathbf{z^c_{norm}}=\mathbf{z^c} \frac{ects_c}{TotalContrib_c}$$

### Summary program outcomes matrix

To find the support of the whole curriculum for each of the program outcomes, one must sum normalized contributions of all courses as follows: 

$$\sum_{c \in C_p} \mathbf{z^c_{norm}}$$

## Evidence based evaluation: grades support

Let's say a student get some grades from all his/her courses. How much he/she achieved program outcomes? YUKARIDAKİ HESABI YAPARKEN X MATRİSİNİ ÖĞRENCİ NOT MATRİSİYLE ÇARPARAK YAPILACAK. NOT: OBS'den export edilen not dosyaları syllabus'taki activity'lerle uyumlu değil; bu konuda her ders için manuel olarak bir eşleştirme şemasının verilmesi gerekecek. Bunun her sömestr değişmesi de mümkün. 

Let's say the program has several students. What is the overall level of achievement of program outcomes? TÜM BÖLÜM ÖĞRENCİLERİNİN ACHIEVEMENT'LARIN ORTALAMASI ALINACAK.
